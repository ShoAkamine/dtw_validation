# Validating dynamic time warping as a measure of gesture form similarity

This repository contains Python/R scripts and processed anonymized data for the article "Validating dynamic time warping as a measure of gesture form similarity".

The Python scripts (under "kinematics") were used to preprocess motion tracking time series data and compute DTW distances. The R scripts were used for statistical analyses.
